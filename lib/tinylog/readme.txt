   Using tinylog
-------------------

To use tinylog as a logging framework, add tinylog-api.jar and an
implementation such as tinylog-impl.jar to the classpath.

tinylog-impl.jar is the default implementation for tinylog. There are also
implementations for application and web servers to use their logging
frameworks. Since tinylog 2, multiple implementations can even be used in
parallel.
